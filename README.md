# Chef GPT

The Chef GPT application prompts the user to enter ingredients, a dish name or a recipe. If the
application recognises the input as ingredients, it will return a dish name. If the input is a dish
name, it will return a recipe. If the input is a recipe, it will criticise it and return a revised
version.

The application will be a chef persona of a random country and its recipes will have influences of
its culture.
